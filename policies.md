## Grading

5% (or 0%) Attendance
15% Labs
20% Homeworks
15% Projects
15% (or 17.5%) Midterm
30% (or 32.5%) Final

There will be 3 projects and about 7 homework assignments. Assignments must be completed individually and will mix programming and short answer questions. Lab assignments will be graded on completion and correctness, but all test cases will be public. Your two lowest labs scores and two lowest homework scores will be dropped.

Lecture attendance counts for 5% of the overall grade and will be recorded using a Google Form that will be open during a random point during lecture. To receive credit for attendance, you must attend at least 3 lectures a week for 6 weeks. There is no partial credit for the attendance grade.

You may choose not to attend lecture, in which case the midterm and final will automatically count for 2.5% more of the overall grade (17.5% and 32.5%).

There will be one midterm in class tentatively scheduled for Tuesday, July 18th. The final exam is scheduled to take place on August 15th from 9:30am-12:30pm. If you miss a midterm for a pre-approved reason, such as a class conflict or illness, the final exam will be used to compute your overall exam score (out of 45%). One alternate final time will be given but you must fill out this Google Form by 11:59pm Friday, June 28: http://bit.ly/su19-alt-final.

## On Time Policy (try not to be late)
No late homeworks or labs will be accepted unless an extension is granted by a staff member. Late projects will be marked off 20% per day late, rounded up to the nearest integer number of days. No project will be accepted more than 3 days late.

## Collaboration Policy (donâ€™t cheat)
Data science is a collaborative activity. While you may talk with others about the homework, we ask that you write your solutions individually. If you do discuss the assignments with others please include their names at the top of your notebook. Keep in mind that content from the homework and vitamins will likely be covered on both the midterm and final. We will be following the EECS departmental policy on Academic Honesty, so be sure you are familiar with it.
